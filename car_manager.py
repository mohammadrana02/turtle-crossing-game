# CAR BEHAVIOUR
# Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly
# generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen.
# No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen
# (think of it as a safe zone for our little turtle).
# Hint: generate a new car only every 6th time the game loop runs.
